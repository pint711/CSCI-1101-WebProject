            Hello! I made this website to give information of music that I either enjoy or find interesting
            and that a majority of people don't know a lot about. 
            I chose to cover this because I enjoy (some of) this type of music more than other popular/mainstream genres.
            I also think music like this is more interesting to learn about since these genres aren't talked about that much, 
            and they have intersting histories (intersting in my opinion).

        <span id="warning">** Fair Warning ** <br> Some of the genres discussed are not just extreme in their sound but in other areas as well.
            I've tried my best to censor and choose examples as too not be deemed too inappropriate. <br>

            The aim of this website is to give information and provide an introduction to obscurer Loud and Extreme music genres.
            Hopefully, you'll have learned something new and start to appreciate things that are out of your comfort zone. 
            Maybe you'll even start to like this type of music 乁( ͡` ͜ʖ ͡°)ㄏ.
